                    <p>In this VR experience, you are put in the role of a tiny adventurer exploring a normal-sized house while collecting various food and trinkets along the way.</p>
                    <p>There are 11 tiny items to collect. Once you pick up a collectable, swing your hand over your shoulder to place it in your backpack.</p>
                    <p>While this experience is meant to be fun and relaxing, it is timed. You will have 12 in-game hours (7:00am to 7:00pm) to collect all the items. You can check the time by looking at your left wristwatch. Can you collect all 11 items?</p>
